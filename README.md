##Explanation of the Code and Framework Model & Device Setup:

We install and import necessary libraries.

GPT‑2 and its tokenizer are loaded and moved to the appropriate device (CPU or GPU).

Caching Mechanism:

A global dictionary (embedding_cache) stores token embeddings.

The function get_embedding simulates a cache miss by adding a delay (time.sleep(0.01)) if the embedding isn’t in the cache. Once stored, subsequent requests for the same token are returned immediately.

Processing Prompts:

The process_prompt function tokenizes the input prompt and retrieves embeddings for each token, measuring the elapsed time.

Experimental Comparison:

The first run with an empty cache simulates the “cold” cache scenario.

The second run on the same prompt uses the warmed cache, which should be faster.

An additional example shows how prefetching can be simulated by iterating through tokens in a new prompt before processing it.

Assumptions Made:

Cache Granularity: We assume the critical performance bottleneck is at the token embedding lookup level.

Simulated Delay: A fixed delay (10ms) per token simulates the memory access latency of a cache miss. Real-world delays will vary based on hardware.

Prefetching Strategy: The simple prefetching demonstrated here assumes that token embeddings can be loaded in advance. In a more complex system, one might use asynchronous prefetching or predictive models to load not just embeddings but also intermediate activations.

Extending the Framework:

Dynamic Profiling: In a full implementation, integrate a profiler to measure cache hit/miss rates and memory access times.

Advanced Prefetching: Incorporate a predictive model that leverages the attention mechanism or sequence analysis to decide which parts of the model’s memory should be prefetched.

Hardware Integration: Consider hardware-level caching strategies by profiling on different architectures and potentially interfacing with lower-level APIs for memory management.
